Project Overview

This repository contains the official website of the Goblin Haven universe—an academic and creative project that blends structured web development (HTML and CSS) with an original narrative set in a dark, fragmented world. The goal is to deliver a visually and conceptually coherent experience that reflects the history, symbolism, and atmosphere of the goblins, while demonstrating organized teamwork supported by GitHub.

Technical Foundation of the Project

General Project Structure

The site was built using HTML and CSS, organized modularly to ensure maintainability and scalability. The core structure includes:

1.	Main file (index and internal pages): Contains the overall layout—headers, sections, containers, text, images, and internal navigation.
2.	styles folder: Holds the main stylesheet(s), defining typography, color palette, sizes, alignments, animations, backgrounds, and overall visual coherence.
3.	assets folder: Stores images, icons, and illustrations (≈70 files). Keeping this folder organized ensured clean routes and error free visuals.
4.	Secondary folders: Contain internal pages such as galleries, character profiles, and thematic sections. Each page has its own file and a proper internal link.

This structure keeps the project clean, readable, and easy to expand.
________________________________________
HTML Development

The HTML was written with a semantic approach to improve accessibility and comprehension:

1.	Main containers divide the layout into header, main, section, article, and footer.
2.	Images and multimedia use relative paths for consistent rendering across devices.
3.	Clear typographic hierarchy using h1, h2, h3, and well structured paragraphs.
4.	Internal navigation via nav, ul, ol, and linked pages.
5.	Basic attention to readability, contrast, and stability across screen sizes.

CSS Development

The central stylesheet defines the site’s visual identity:

1.	Typography and color palette: Dark tones, bright greens, and glowing effects to match the narrative’s atmosphere.
2.	Layout: Proper spacing, margins, alignment, and proportional design for visual balance.
3.	Backgrounds: Full cover background images with centered positioning for key sections.
4.	Visual effects: Transitions, shadows, light effects, and transformations that add mood and dynamism.
5.	Basic responsiveness: While full responsiveness was not implemented, flexible units and container design maintain stability.

Version Control & GitHub Workflow

GitHub served as the project’s collaboration backbone. The team worked mainly with graphical tools such as GitHub Desktop and the GitHub interface.

Team Workflow

1.	The repository was created and shared with the team.
2.	Each member downloaded a local copy (ZIP or GitHub Desktop).
3.	Before each work session, members updated their local version to avoid conflicts.
4.	Changes were recorded with descriptive commits.
5.	Updates were pushed to the online repository.
6.	Pull requests were created to merge finalized work into the main branch.
________________________________________
Branch Management

A main branch named master was created. Each member worked on their own branch:

1.	branch-cris
2.	branch-cesar
3.	branch-duvan
4.	branch-juan
   
Branches allowed each member to contribute independently and merge only when work was ready.
________________________________________
Conflict Resolution

If two people edited the same file, GitHub Desktop displayed the differences. The team reviewed and decided which version to keep before merging.

Best Practices Applied

1.	Clear and descriptive commit messages
2.	Frequent updates and pushes
3.	Reviewing local changes before syncing
4.	Avoiding duplicate files
5.	Maintaining an organized folder structure
6.	Continuous communication among members
________________________________________
Deployment

The site was deployed using GitHub Pages. Steps:

1.	Select the deployment branch in repository settings.
2.	Enable GitHub Pages.
3.	Wait for automatic processing.
4.	Use and share the public link.

Narrative & Design Integration

The story deeply influenced both the structure and the aesthetic of the site.

World Description

In ancient times, goblins emerged as small beings born from sparks of primordial magic escaping the fire of creation. They were once timid, curious, and numerous. Their nomadic tribes moved between forests, ruins, caverns, and improvised camps.
Centuries of survival in hostile lands forged their identity. They became masters of improvisation—creating traps, tools, and inventions from whatever they found. Their chaotic humor confused neighboring species, who often misjudged them as thieves, liars, or troublemakers.
To goblins, creativity was sacred. Their burrows overflowed with patched together artifacts—sometimes brilliant, sometimes dangerous. They believed every object had a “hidden second use,” from broken gears to discarded bones.
Some tribes became mercenaries, others traders of oddities, and a few expert saboteurs capable of infiltrating any fortress. Their reputation varies widely: pests to some, misunderstood geniuses to others—but always unpredictable.

Goblins as the Project’s Symbol

Goblins reflect the team’s journey:

1.	Starting from simple foundations
2.	Learning through chaos and experimentation
3.	Combining different skills
4.	Overcoming errors and conflicts
________________________________________
Connection Between Story and Design

1.	Dark backgrounds → shadowed lands
2.	Bold typography → ancient chronicle tone
3.	Textured images → raw and mystical atmosphere
4.	Page structure → resembles an old digital archive

Team Species — Symbolic Roles

Each member represents a symbolic species in the universe:

1.	Ancient & Wise: conceptual guidance
2.	Technological: logic and structural clarity
3.	Magical: creativity and aesthetic vision
4.	Wild / Instinctive: experimentation and energy
   
The goblins unify these perspectives as the project’s core beings.

Future Expansion

The project’s structure supports ongoing growth:

1.	New regions, species, and storylines
2.	Additional pages and visual sections
3.	Improved responsiveness
4.	More interactive components through JavaScript

Legacy: Goblins embody resilience and creativity—small, clever, chaotic, and capable of turning disorder into innovation, just as the team did throughout development.

Additional Technical Notes

1.	Consider modular styles or Sass for scalability.
2.	Enhance mobile responsiveness with media queries.
3.	Use GitHub Actions for automated validation or deployment.
4.	Maintain a detailed README.md with installation and contribution guidelines.
