WORLD NAME
- Goblins: Children of the Ancient Shadow

WORLD DESCRIPTION
- In the earliest days of this world, the goblins emerged as small creatures from the deep forests and the damp caverns, descendants—according to their own legends—of sparks of primordial magic that escaped from the fire of creation. At first, they were timid, curious, and extremely numerous beings. They lived in nomadic tribes that followed the cycles of nature, moving between caves, ancient ruins, and improvised camps.

As centuries passed, their reputation began to take shape from their own instincts: the need to survive in hostile territories led them to develop an almost innate cunning, an extraordinary skill for improvising tools, traps, and shelters, and a chaotic sense of humor that often confused their neighbors. For many other species, this combination became a mark of distrust. They started to be seen as opportunistic thieves, liars, or simple troublemakers. But that perception was only one side of the story.

Among goblins, creativity and inventiveness were sacred virtues. Their burrows were filled with patched-together artifacts—sometimes ingenious, sometimes dangerous—and their songs told of glorious battles against giant predators or endless arguments over who had the right to the last portion of blue mushrooms. They believed that every object had a “hidden second use,” so everything from broken gears to abandoned bones could become tools, weapons, or ritual ornaments.

Some tribes became famous as cheap mercenaries, others as traders of impossible curiosities, and a few as saboteurs capable of sneaking into any fortress. Over time, the world began to speak of goblins as unpredictable creatures: just as capable of destroying a village by accident as of saving it unintentionally while pursuing some absurd goal.

Today, their reputation is contradictory. Some see them as wandering pests; others, as misunderstood geniuses; and many, simply as living chaos. Yet everyone agrees on one thing: where goblins exist, there is never a lack of noise, ingenuity… and trouble.

WORKING WITH BRANCHES
- In the project, a main branch called master was created. From it, each team member generated their own working branch, identified by their name:

branch-cris
branch-cesar
branch-duvan
branch-juan

Each member worked independently within their own branch, making the corresponding commits for the changes and progress of their part of the project.
When a member finished a task or wanted to integrate their contributions into the main project, they went to GitHub to create a pull request. Through this process, the changes were reviewed and, once approved, the merge was performed toward the master branch, thus unifying the files and keeping the project organized and up to date.
